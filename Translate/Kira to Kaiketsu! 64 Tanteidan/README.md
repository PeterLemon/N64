N64 Japanese To English Translation
====================================
<br />
Translation by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the bass assembler by byuu.<br />
I use a special version of bass by ARM9 which has been updated with SuperFX/GSU Risc output:<br />
https://github.com/ARM9/bass<br />
I have also included an IPS file of the translation as a patch.<br />
<br />
Special thanks to Zoinkity, who inspired me to get into N64 translating =D<br />
Please check out RomHacking & their forum, a great resource for translation work:<br />

<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
You will need the original Japanese ROM in .Z64 (Big-Endian) Format, in the root directory of this patch<br />
All the code compiles into a single binary (ROMNAME.Z64) file.<br />
Using bass Run: make.bat<br />
Or you can patch the original Japanese ROM using the IPS file.<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
I only test with a real N64 using a 64drive Cartridge by Retroactive:<br />

<br />
You can also use N64 emulators like cen64 & the MESS N64 Driver.
